Defines an **Service Interface** containing a set of functions to **access a data-store / repository** including CRUD operations, filtering and meta data-access to retrieve schema information.

This is designed to be implementable also as web service endpoint using the call-based approach of UJMW instead of rest (because we want more flexibility than HTTP-verbs can offer).
